# ClassBuddy

ClassBuddy is a Slot Selector substitute designed for managing college class schedules efficiently. The system integrates frontend, backend, and operating system concepts such as FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) and Priority Scheduling algorithms to optimize slot allocation for students and teachers.

---

## Project Overview

ClassBuddy aims to simplify timetable management by providing:

- Real-time slot selection and availability checking
- Backend management of timetable and requests
- Implementation of OS scheduling algorithms (FCFS, Priority Scheduling) to manage slot requests and allocations efficiently
- Role-based access with different portals for students and teachers

This project is intended to replace traditional manual slot selection systems in colleges with a more streamlined and automated process.
